        "I use to work with a developer team who worked on various projects. I was put on a music royalty investment platform that allowed users to buy and trade fractional ownership in music catalogs.",
        "My main responsibilities were focused on the frontend of the web application, integrating backend APIs, data consistency and smooth user interactions across the platform. Throughout the project, I also worked with services like payment processing and eKYC (Electronic Know Your Customer) by handling tasks related to UI behavior, API responses, and bug fixes. While I wasnâ€™t in charge of implementing these systems from scratch, I gained hands-on experience in how they operate and integrate within a secure, real-money platform"
